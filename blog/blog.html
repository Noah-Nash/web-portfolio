      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h2>13 May 2021</h2>
      <p>
        Somebody once told me The world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest
        tool in the shed She was looking kinda dumb With her finger and her
        thumb In shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead
      </p>

      <p>
        Well the years start coming And they don't stop coming Fed to the rules
        and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense Not to live for fun Your
        brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do So much to see
      </p>

      <p>
        So what's wrong with taking the back street You'll never know if you
        don't go
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey now You're an all star Get your
        game on Go play
      </p>

      <p>
        Hey now You're a rock Star Get the show on Get paid And all that
        glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold It's a cool place
        And they say it gets colder You're bundled up now Wait 'til you get
        older But the meteor men Beg to differ Judging by the hole in the
        satellite picture
      </p>

      <p>The ice we skate</p>

      <p>
        Is getting pretty thin The waters getting warm So you might as well swim
        My world's on fire
      </p>

      <p>How about yours That's the way I like it and I never get bored</p>

      <p>Hey now</p>

      <p>
        You're an all star Get your game on Go play Hey now You're a rock star
        Get the show on
      </p>

      <p>Get paid</p>

      <p>And all that glitters is gold</p>

      <p>
        Only shooting stars break the mold Hey now You're an all star Get your
        game on Go play
      </p>

      <p>Hey now You're a rock star</p>

      <p>
        Get the show on Get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting
        stars Somebody once asked Could you spare some change for gas I need to
        get myself away from this place I said yep
      </p>

      <p>What a concept I could use A little fuel myself</p>

      <p>
        And we could all use a little change Well the years start coming And
        they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
